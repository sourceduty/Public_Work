### Professional Structure

![Public](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fae7584-5ec2-4884-8b55-87ec92e51cbb)

Sourceduty, as a privately-owned creative and technological company, offers a significantly different ownership and employment structure compared to public workers in government. In Sourceduty, ownership is tied directly to the founding individuals or investors, meaning that Alex, as the owner, holds full equity and decision-making power over the company's operations and direction. Employees at Sourceduty work under the leadership of the owner, contributing their talents and skills to the company but without owning any part of it unless equity options are provided as part of compensation packages. This can allow for more direct rewards for their work, such as bonuses or stock options, which are often designed to align individual success with company growth. The focus in a private company like Sourceduty is on innovation, profitability, and the scalability of its creative projects and digital assets.

In contrast, public workers, such as government employees, do not own any part of the entity they work for. Government agencies and departments are public institutions, funded by taxpayer money and managed by elected officials or appointed leaders. Public workers are responsible for implementing policies, managing public services, and supporting the common good, but they have no ownership stake in the government. Their compensation is typically limited to salaries and benefits, with little opportunity to directly influence the financial success or trajectory of the government itself. The primary focus for public workers is on service, policy execution, and maintaining the public trust, rather than on driving profits or scaling a business. The motivations and rewards in government employment thus tend to center more on stability and long-term service than on ownership or entrepreneurial growth.
